Differential impact of white matter hyperintensities on long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients with large artery atherosclerosis
  Background  The presence of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) is related to poor long-term outcomes in stroke patients. However, the long-term outcome is unknown in patients with both large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) and WMH.    Methods  We investigated the impact of WMH on long-term outcome in patients with LAA. Consecutive patients in a prospective stroke registry were included. Patients were followed for a median of 7.7 years (interquartile range, 5.6–9.7). The degree of WMH was assessed by Fazekas grade on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Total WMH burden was calculated by summation of Fazekas scores in periventricular and deep white matter. Severe WMH was defined as total burden score ≥ 3.    Results  Among 2529 patients, 639 patients (25.3%) were classified with the LAA subtype. After applying exclusion criteria, the data from 538 patients were analyzed. The mean patient age was 65.7 ± 10.3 years. Severe WMHs were found in 243 patients (45.2%). During follow-up, 200 patients (37.2%) died. Cox regression analysis showed that LAA patients with severe WMH had a 1.50-fold (95% CI, 1.12–2.00, p = 0.007) higher death rate compared to those without. In the older age group (≥65 years), Cox regression revealed that patients with severe WMH had a 1.75-fold (95% CI, 1.15–2.65, p = 0.008) higher 5-year death rate, whereas the younger age group did not have this association.    Conclusion  The degree of WMH might be a surrogate marker for long-term outcome in patients with LAA. Atherosclerotic burdens in both small and large arteries might impact long-term prognosis in ischemic stroke patients.
