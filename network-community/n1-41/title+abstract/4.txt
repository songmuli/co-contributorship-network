The endogenous cardiotonic steroid Marinobufagenin and decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate at follow-up in patients with arterial hypertension
  Background  Marinobufagenin (MBG) is an endogenous cardiotonic steroid (CTS) that inhibits the Na+/K+-ATPase. Human MBG is significantly increased in end-stage renal disease and immunization against MBG attenuates cardiovascular fibrosis in a rat model of uremic cardiomyopathy. Mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRA) block MBG binding sites and decrease proteinuria in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. We therefore aimed to investigate the association of MBG and albuminuria, as a marker of renal damage, as well as MBG and decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).    Methods  The Graz endocrine causes of hypertension (GECOH) study is a single center study of adults routinely referred for screening of endocrine hypertension. Plasma MBG was measured by an enzyme-linked immunoassay, and in a post-hoc analysis, follow-up creatinine levels were obtained. Patients with proteinuria >3.5g/day at baseline were excluded from further evaluation.    Results  We measured MBG concentrations in 40 hypertensive subjects and excluded one patient due to pre-existing proteinuria. Plasma MBG was significantly correlated with albuminuria (Spearman ρ = .357; p = .028) and proteinuria ( ρ = .336; p = .039). In linear regression analysis, the association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI (β = .306; p = .036), and for mean systolic blood pressure (β = .352; p = .034). In follow-up analyses (N = 30), MBG was significantly associated with decline in GFR after adjustment for time-to-follow-up (β = -.374; p = .042).    Conclusion  The findings suggest that MBG plasma concentrations were associated with albuminuria as well as decline in kidney function. Whether MBG predicts hard renal endpoints warrants further investigations.
