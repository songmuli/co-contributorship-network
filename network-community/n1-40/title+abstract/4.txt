Second-line glucose-lowering drugs added to metformin and the risk of hospitalization for heart failure: A nationwide cohort study
  Aim  To compare the risks of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) associated with sulfonylurea (SU), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i), and thiazolidinedione (TZD) as add-on medications to metformin (MET) therapy using the data of Korean adults with type-2 diabetes from the Korean National Health Insurance database.    Methods  We identified 98,383 people who received SU (n = 42,683), DPP-4i (n = 50,310), or TZD (n = 5,390) added to initial treatment of MET monotherapy in patients with type-2 diabetes. The main outcome was the hospitalization for HHF. Hazard ratios for HHF by type of second-line glucose-lowering medication were estimated by Cox-proportional hazard models. Sex, age, duration of MET monotherapy, Charlson Comorbidity Index and additional comorbidities, and calendar year were controlled as potential confounders.    Results  The observed numbers (rate per 100,000 person-years) of HHF events were 1,129 (658) for MET+SU users, 710 (455) for MET+DPP-4i users, and 110 (570) for MET+TZD users. Compared to that for MET+SU users (reference group), the adjusted hazard ratios for HHF events were 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.69–0.84) for MET+DPP-4i users and 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.79–1.17) for MET+TZD users.    Conclusion  DPP-4i as an add-on therapy to MET may lower the risks of HHF compared with SU.
