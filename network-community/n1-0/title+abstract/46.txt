Age, sex and disease-specific associations between resting heart rate and cardiovascular mortality in the UK BIOBANK
  Objective  To define the sex, age, and disease-specific associations of resting heart rate (RHR) with cardiovascular and mortality outcomes in 502,534 individuals from the UK Biobank over 7–12 years of prospective follow-up.    Methods  The main outcomes were all-cause, cardiovascular, and ischaemic heart disease mortality. Additional outcomes included incident acute myocardial infarction (AMI), fatal AMI, and cancer mortality. We considered a wide range of confounders and the effects of competing hazards. Results are reported as hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause mortality and sub-distribution hazard ratios (SHR) for other outcomes with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) per 10bpm increment of RHR.    Results  In men, for every 10bpm increase of RHR there was 22% (HR 1.22, CI 1.20 to 1.24, p = 3×10 −123 ) greater hazard of all-cause and 17% (SHR 1.17, CI 1.13 to 1.21, p = 5.6×10 −18 ) greater hazard of cardiovascular mortality; for women, corresponding figures were 19% (HR 1.19, CI 1.16 to 1.22, p = 8.9×10 −45 ) and 14% (SHR 1.14, CI 1.07 to 1.22, p = 0.00008). Associations between RHR and ischaemic outcomes were of greater magnitude amongst men than women, but with similar magnitude of association for non-cardiovascular cancer mortality [men (SHR 1.18, CI 1.15–1.21, p = 5.2×10 −46 ); women 15% (SHR 1.15, CI 1.11–1.18, p = 3.1×10 −18 )]. Associations with all-cause, incident AMI, and cancer mortality were of greater magnitude at younger than older ages.    Conclusions  RHR is an independent predictor of mortality, with variation by sex, age, and disease. Ischaemic disease appeared a more important driver of this relationship in men, and associations were more pronounced at younger ages.
