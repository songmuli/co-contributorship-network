Incidence and prevalence of multiple sclerosis in Hungary based on record linkage of nationwide multiple healthcare administrative data
  Objectives  As there were only regional studies in Hungary about the prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS), we aimed to estimate its epidemiological features using data of Hungary’s single-payer health insurance system.    Methods  Pseudonymized database of claims reported by hospitals and outpatient services between 2004–2016 was analyzed and linked with an independent database of outpatient pharmacy refills between 2010–2016. We established an administrative case definition of MS and validated it on medical records of 309 consecutive patients. A subject was defined as MS-patient if received MS diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, code G35) on three or more occasions at least in 2 calendar years and at least once documented by a neurologist. Patients were counted as incident cases in the year of the first submitted claim for MS. We allowed a 6-year-long run-in period, so only data between 2010–2015 are discussed.    Results  Sensitivity of the administrative case definition turned out to be 99%, while specificity was >99%. Crude prevalence of MS has increased from 109.3/100,000 in 2010 to 130.8/100,000 in 2015 ( p -value = 0.000003). Crude incidence declined from 7.1/100,000 (2010) to 5.4/100,000 (2015) ( p -value = 0.018). Direct standardization − based on European standard population and results of nationwide Hungarian census of 2011 − revealed that age standardized prevalence was 105.2/100,000 (2010), which has grown to 127.2/100,000 (2015) ( p -value = 0.000001). Age standardized incidence rate declined from 6.7/100,000 (2010) to 5.1/100,000 (2015) ( p -value = 0.016). The ratio of MS-patients receiving ≥1 prescription for disease modifying treatment increased from 0.19 (2010) to 0.29 (2015) ( p -value = 0.0051). The female/male ratio of prevalent cases remained 2.6.    Discussion  The prevalence of MS in Hungary is higher than previously reported, the incidence rate is moderate. The prevalence is rising, the incidence rate shows decline. The proportion of patients receiving disease modifying treatment grows but was still around 30% in 2015.
