Untargeted high-resolution plasma metabolomic profiling predicts outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease
  Objective  Patients with CAD have substantial residual risk of mortality, and whether hitherto unknown small-molecule metabolites and metabolic pathways contribute to this risk is unclear. We sought to determine the predictive value of plasma metabolomic profiling in patients with CAD.    Approach and results  Untargeted high-resolution plasma metabolomic profiling of subjects undergoing coronary angiography was performed using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Metabolic features and pathways associated with mortality were identified in 454 subjects using metabolome-wide association studies and Mummichog, respectively, and validated in 322 subjects. A metabolomic risk score comprising of log-transformed HR estimates of metabolites that associated with mortality and passed LASSO regression was created and its performance validated. In 776 subjects (66.8 years, 64% male, 17% Black), 433 and 357 features associated with mortality (FDR-adjusted q<0.20); and clustered into 21 and 9 metabolic pathways in first and second cohorts, respectively. Six pathways (urea cycle/amino group, tryptophan, aspartate/asparagine, lysine, tyrosine, and carnitine shuttle) were common. A metabolomic risk score comprising of 7 metabolites independently predicted mortality in the second cohort (HR per 1-unit increase 2.14, 95%CI 1.62, 2.83). Adding the score to a model of clinical predictors improved risk discrimination (delta C-statistic 0.039, 95%CI -0.006, 0.086; and Integrated Discrimination Index 0.084, 95%CI 0.030, 0.151) and reclassification (continuous Net Reclassification Index 23.3%, 95%CI 7.9%, 38.2%).    Conclusions  Differential regulation of six metabolic pathways involved in myocardial energetics and systemic inflammation is independently associated with mortality in patients with CAD. A novel risk score consisting of representative metabolites is highly predictive of mortality.
