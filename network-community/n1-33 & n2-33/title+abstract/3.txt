Metabolomics approach in the investigation of depression biomarkers in pharmacologically induced immune-related depression
  Background  The aim of this study was to identify previously unrecognised biological pathways and biomarkers that might expand the inflammatory hypothesis of depression.    Methods  Broad metabolomics analyses in plasma samples from 31 chronic hepatitis C-infected patients with and without immune-related depression were carried out using the Absolute IDQ p180 kit—a targeted metabolomics approach of combined direct flow injection and liquid chromatography that measures acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and sugars.    Results  The measurements showed that the average concentration of the branched-chain amino acid isoleucine was significantly lower in depressive HCV patients in comparison to non-depressive HCV patients [depression group: Median 51.35 (43.4–60.2 μmol/L) vs. Median 62.10 (38.4–81.7 μmol/L); U = -2.958; p = 0.002]. All other amino acids, acylcarnitines, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, sugars, liver enzymes and thyroid levels showed no statistically significant differences.    Conclusions  The results of the present study suggest that the branched-chain amino acid isoleucine might play a role in the pathophysiology of immune-related major depression, which expands existing knowledge about inflammatory hypothesis of depression.
