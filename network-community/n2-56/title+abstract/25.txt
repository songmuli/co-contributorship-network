Significance of serum galactose deficient IgA1 as a potential biomarker for IgA nephropathy: A case control study
  Background  IgA nephropathy(IgAN) is a common glomerular disease with a higher risk of progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in certain ethnic populations. Since galactose deficient IgA1(Gd-IgA1) is a critical molecule in its pathogenesis, it has generated interest as a biomarker for this disease.    Methods  We measured serum Gd-IgA1 levels using a non- lectin based enzyme linked immunoassay(ELISA) in 136 immunosuppression naïve patients with primary IgAN and 110 controls(60-non IgA glomerular diseases, 50-healthy volunteers).    Results  Median serum Gd-IgA1 levels were significantly higher in IgAN patients [13135.6(2723.3,59603.8)ng/ml] compared to those with non IgA glomerular disease [4954.8(892.9,18256.2) ng/ml] and healthy controls [6299.5(1993.2,19256) ng/ml] and this was observed even after log transformation and adjustment for age and gender(p<0.0001). Considering a cut-off value of serum Gd-IGA1≥7982.1ng/ml, the sensitivity for diagnosing IgAN compared to healthy controls was 74.3% and specificity was 72.0% with a positive predictive value of 87.8% and negative predictive value of 50.7%. The serum Gd-IgA1 level did not co-relate with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, urine protein creatinine ratio and the M, E, S, T and C scores on renal biopsy. The renal survival (absence of >30% decrease in eGFR, ESRD or death) was lower in patients with higher serum Gd-IgA1 levels(≥7982ng/ml) than those who had lower levels but it was not statistically significant(p = 0.486).    Conclusion  Serum Gd-IgA1 level is higher in IgAN patients compared to non-IgA glomerular diseases and healthy controls and has a good positive predictive value for diagnosis. However, it does not correlate with clinical and histological characteristics of disease severity and does not predict disease progression.
