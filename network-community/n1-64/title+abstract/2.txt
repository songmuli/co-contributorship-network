Hypertension genetic risk score is associated with burden of coronary heart disease among patients referred for coronary angiography
  Background  Recent GWAS studies have identified more than 300 SNPs associated with variation in blood pressure. We investigated whether a genetic risk score constructed from these variants is associated with burden of coronary heart disease.    Methods  From 2010–2014, 4,809 individuals admitted to coronary angiography in Capital Region of Copenhagen were genotyped. We calculated hypertension GRS comprised of GWAS identified SNPs associated with blood pressure. We performed logistic regression analyses to estimate the risk of hypertension and prevalent CHD. We also assessed the severity of CHD associated with the GRS. The analyses were performed using GRS quartiles. We used the Inter99 cohort to validate our results and to investigate for possible pleiotropy for the GRS with other CHD risk factors.    Results  In COGEN, adjusted odds ratios comparing the 2 nd , 3 rd and 4 th cumulative GRS quartiles with the reference were 1.12(95% CI 0.95–1.33), 1.35(95% CI 1.14–1.59) and 1.29(95% CI 1.09–1.53) respectively, for prevalent CHD. The adjusted multinomial logistic regression showed that 3 rd and 4 th GRS quartiles were associated with increased odds of developing two(OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04–1.71 and OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.06–1.75, respectively) and three coronary vessel disease(OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.36–2.30 and OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.26–2.15, respectively). Similar results for incident CHD were observed in the Inter99 cohort. The hypertension GRS did not associate with type 2 diabetes, smoking, BMI or hyperlipidemia.    Conclusion  Hypertension GRS quartiles were associated with an increased risk of hypertension, prevalent CHD, and burden of coronary vessel disease in a dose-response pattern. We showed no evidence for pleiotropy with other risk factors for CHD.
