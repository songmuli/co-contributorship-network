Cardiovascular risk factors in HIV infected individuals: Comparison with general adult control population in Greece
  Background  Although combined antiretroviral therapy has substantially improved the prognosis of people living with HIV (PLHIV), mortality remains higher compared to the general population, mainly due to higher prevalence of non-HIV-related comorbidities, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We assessed the prevalence of CVD risk and its contributing factors in adult PLHIV versus general population controls in Greece.    Settings  Cross-sectional comparison of PLHIV (Athens-Multicenter-AIDS-Cohort-Study; AMACS) versus general population controls (National health examination survey; EMENO).    Methods  All HIV-infected adults with ≥1 measurement of interest (blood pressure, lipids, glucose, weight, height) between 2012–2014 and all EMENO participants (2014–2016) were included. Ten-year total CVD risk was estimated using the Framingham (FRS) or the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) equations.    Results  5839 PLHIV (median age:41.6 years, 85.4% males) and 4820 controls (median age:48 years, 48.4% males) were included. Adjusting for age, sex and origin, PLHIV were more likely to be current smokers (adjusted OR:1.53 [95% CI:1.35–1.74]) and dyslipidemic (aOR:1.18; [1.04–1.34]), less likely to be obese (aOR:0.44 [0.38–0.52], with no differences in hypertension, diabetes or high (≥20%) FRS but with greater odds of high (≥5%) SCORE (aOR:1.55 [1.05–2.30]). Further adjustment for educational level, anti-HCV positivity and BMI showed higher prevalence of hypertension in PLHIV.    Conclusions  Despite the relative absence of obesity, PLHIV have higher prevalence of traditional CVD risk factors and higher risk of fatal CVD compared to general population. Regular screening and early management of CVD risk factors in PLHIV should be of high priority for CVD prevention.
