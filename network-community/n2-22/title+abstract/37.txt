Prevalence and predictors for sustained remission in rheumatoid arthritis
  Objective  Remission is a key goal in managing rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with sustained remission as the preferred sequelae of short-term remission. However little is known about the predictors of sustained remission for patients reaching remission. Using two independent cohorts, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence and predictors for sustained remission.    Methods  The study cohort consisted of subjects with RA from the Brigham and Women's Hospital Rheumatoid Arthritis Sequential Study (BRASS) and the Korean Observational Study Network for Arthritis (KORONA). We analyzed subjects who reached remission in 2009 with follow up data for two consecutive years. Remission was defined by the Disease Activity Score 28- (DAS28-CRP) of less than 2.6. Sustained remission was defined as three consecutive annual visits in remission. Predictors for sustained remission were identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis.    Results  A total of 465 subjects were in remission in 2009. Sustained remission was achieved by 53 of 92 (57.5%) in BRASS and by 198 of 373 (53.1%) in KORONA. In multivariate analyses, baseline predictors of sustained remission were: disease duration less than 5 years [odds ratio (OR) 1.96, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.08–3.58], Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ) score of 0 (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.18–2.74), and non-use of oral glucocorticoid (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.01–2.47).    Conclusion  More than half of RA subjects in remission in 2009 remained in remission through 2011. Short disease duration, no disability, and non-use of oral glucocorticoid at baseline were associated with sustained remission.
