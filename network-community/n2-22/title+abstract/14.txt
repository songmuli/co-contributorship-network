MRI-defined paraspinal muscle morphology in Japanese population: The Wakayama Spine Study
  Objective  This study aimed to establish sex- and age-dependent distributions of the cross sectional area and fatty infiltration ratio of paraspinal muscles, and to examine the correlation between paraspinal muscle degeneration and low back pain in the Japanese population.    Methods  In this cross-sectional study, data from 796 participants (241 men, 555 women; mean age, 63.5 years) were analyzed. The measurement of the cross sectional area and fatty infiltration ratio of the erector spinae and multifidus from the level of T12/L1 to L4/5 and psoas major at the level of T12/L1 was performed using axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between fatty infiltration of the paraspinal muscles and the prevalence of low back pain.    Results  The cross sectional area was larger in men than women, and tended to decrease with age, with the exception of the erector spinae at T12/L1 and L1/2 in women. The fatty infiltration ratio was lower in men than women, except for multifidus at T12/L1 in 70–79 year-olds and psoas major in those less than 50 years-old, and tended to increase with age. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index showed that the fatty infiltration ratio of the erector spinae at L1/2 and L2/3 was significantly associated with low back pain (L1/2 level: odds ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.005–1.104; L2/3 level: odds ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.001–1.113).    Conclusion  This study measured the cross sectional area and fatty infiltration ratio of paraspinal muscles in the Japanese population using magnetic resonance imaging, and demonstrated that the fatty infiltration ratio of the erector spinae in the upper lumbar spine was significantly associated with the presence of low back pain. The measurements could be used as reference values, which are important for future comparative studies.
