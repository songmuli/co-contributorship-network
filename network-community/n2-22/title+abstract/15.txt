Risk factors for incidental durotomy during posterior open spine surgery for degenerative diseases in adults: A multicenter observational study
 Incidental durotomy (ID) is a common intraoperative complication of spine surgery. It can lead to persistent cerebrospinal fluid leakage, which may cause serious complications, including severe headache, pseudomeningocele formation, nerve root entrapment, and intracranial hemorrhage. As a result, it contributes to higher healthcare costs and poor patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to clarify the independent risk factors that can cause ID during posterior open spine surgery for degenerative diseases in adults. We conducted a prospective multicenter study of adult patients who underwent posterior open spine surgery for degenerative diseases at 10 participating hospitals from July 2010 to June 2013. A total of 4,652 consecutive patients were enrolled. We evaluated potential risk factors, including age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification, the presence of diabetes mellitus, the use of hemodialysis, smoking status, steroid intake, location of the surgery, type of operative procedure, and past surgical history in the operated area. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors associated with ID. The incidence of ID was 8.2% (380/4,652). Corrective vertebral osteotomy and revision surgery were identified as independent risk factors for ID, while cervical surgery and discectomy were identified as factors that independently protected against ID during posterior open spine surgery for degenerative diseases in adults. Therefore, we identified 2 independent risk factors for and 2 protective factors against ID. These results may contribute to making surgeons aware of the risk factors for ID and can be used to counsel patients on the risks and complications associated with open spine surgery.
