C-Tb skin test to diagnose Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in children and HIV-infected adults: A phase 3 trial
  Background  C-Tb, an ESAT-6/CFP-10-based skin test, has similar sensitivity for active TB compared to tuberculin skin test (TST) and QuantiFERON-TB-Gold-In-Tube (QFT). However, data are limited in children and HIV-infected persons.    Methods  Asymptomatic South African contacts <5 years (n = 87; HIV-uninfected), or symptomatic individuals of all ages presenting to clinics with suspected TB (n = 1003; 30% HIV-infected) were recruited from eight South African centres. C-Tb and TST were allocated to either forearm double blinded. Samples for QFT were collected in parallel, and test-positivity rates were compared.    Results  In participants with microbiologically confirmed TB (n = 75; 45% HIV-infected) sensitivity of C-Tb, TST and QFT were similar (72% versus 75% versus 73%; p>0.5). All 3 tests had similar positivity rates in HIV-infected participants with active TB, however, positivity rates were reduced when CD4 counts were <100 cells/Î¼L. In participants where active TB was excluded (n = 920), C-Tb (41%), TST (43%), and QFT (44%) also had similar test-positivity rates. Among asymptomatic contacts aged below five, 32% (28/87) tested positive with C-Tb and 32% (28/87) with TST (concordance 89%). Overall, C-Tb and TST showed a similar safety profile.    Conclusion  C-Tb was safe and showed similar test-positivity rates, compared to TST and QFT, in children and HIV-infected persons with active or latent M . tuberculosis infection. These data inform the utility of C-Tb in clinical practice.    Trial registration  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01642888 .  EudraCT 2011-005078-40.
