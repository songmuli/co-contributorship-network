Teaching and performing audits on caesarean delivery reduce the caesarean delivery rate
  Aim  To assess the factors associated with lower rate of caesarean deliveries in the South of France, based on the characteristics and organisation of the region’s 40 maternity facilities and the characteristics of the practitioners in these facilities.    Method  A retrospective study from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2015. Data were collected by the Mediterranean network and a declarative survey was completed by each maternity facility in the region to study factor which could be associated with lower caesarean rate by univariate and multivariate analysis.    Results  250 564 women gave birth during this period, of which 55 097 by caesarean section. The mean caesarean delivery rate over the four years was 22.0%. The rate was significantly higher in private maternity facilities [23.9% (21.9%– 25.8%), p<0.05] and type III (maximum care level) maternity facilities [24.2% (21.3%– 27.1%), p<0.05]. After a stepwise regression, the factors associated with a decrease in the caesarean delivery rate were audits concerning caesarean delivery (19.83%, β = - 2.48, p = 0.03 over the four years) and the provision of training to trainee doctors at the maternity facility (20.28%, β = - 1.08, p = 0.04 over the four years).    Conclusion  Performing audits in relation to caesarean deliveries could affect the caesarean. Teaching trainee doctors could be an indicator of quality of caesarean practices. They should be encouraged in maternity facilities to reduce the rate of caesareans.
