Clinical significance of myeloperoxidase-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody in idiopathic interstitial pneumonias
  Objective  Although a possible association among myeloperoxidase-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has been suggested, the clinical significance of MPO-ANCA in idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), including IPF and non-IPF, remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the frequency of MPO-ANCA positivity, as well as MPA incidence and risk factors for development in patients initially diagnosed with IIP.    Methods  We retrospectively analysed 305 consecutive patients who were initially diagnosed as IIP and had MPO-ANCA results available.    Results  Of the 305 patients, 26 (8.5%) were MPO-ANCA-positive. Baseline characteristics were similar between the MPO-ANCA-positive and -negative patients. The cumulative 5-year MPA incidence was 24.3% in the MPO-ANCA-positive patients and 0% in the -negative patients ( P < 0.0001). MPO-ANCA was positive in 15 of 133 (11.3%) patients initially diagnosed with IPF and in 11 of 172 (6.3%) patients initially diagnosed with non-IPF ( P = 0.56), with cumulative 5-year MPA incidence of 6.2% and 1.0%, respectively ( P = 0.10). Multivariate analysis revealed that UIP pattern on HRCT (HR = 3.20, P < 0.01) and no treatment for IIP (HR = 3.52, P < 0.01) were independently associated with MPA development in MPO-ANCA-positive patients.    Conclusion  MPO-ANCA positivity was uncommon, but was associated with subsequent MPA development in patients initially diagnosed with IIP, including both IPF and non-IPF cases. The study suggested that attention should be paid to MPA development in MPO-ANCA-positive IIP patients with UIP pattern on HRCT and those without treatment for IIP.
