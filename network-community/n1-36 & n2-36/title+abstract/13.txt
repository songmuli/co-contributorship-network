Foramen magnum stenosis and midface hypoplasia in C-type natriuretic peptide-deficient rats and restoration by the administration of human C-type natriuretic peptide with 53 amino acids
 C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP)-knockout (KO) rats exhibit impaired skeletal growth, with long bones shorter than those in wild-type (WT) rats. This study compared craniofacial morphology in the CNP-KO rat with that in the Spontaneous Dwarf Rat (SDR), a growth hormone (GH)-deficient model. The effects of subcutaneous administration of human CNP with 53 amino acids (CNP-53) from 5 weeks of age for 4 weeks on craniofacial morphology in CNP-KO rats were also investigated. Skulls of CNP-KO rats at 9 weeks of age were longitudinally shorter and the foramen magnum was smaller than WT rats. There were no differences in foramen magnum stenosis and midface hypoplasia between CNP-KO rats at 9 and 33 weeks of age. These morphological features were the same as those observed in CNP-KO mice and activated fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 achondroplasia-phenotype mice. In contrast, SDR did not exhibit foramen magnum stenosis and midface hypoplasia, despite shorter stature than in control rats. After administration of exogenous CNP-53, the longitudinal skull length and foramen magnum size in CNP-KO rats were significantly greater, and full or partial rescue was confirmed. The synchondrosis at the cranial base in CNP-KO rats is closed at 9 weeks, but not at 4 weeks of age. In contrast, synchondrosis closure in CNP-KO rats treated with CNP-53 was incomplete at 9 weeks of age. Administration of exogenous CNP-53 accelerated craniofacial skeletogenesis, leading to improvement in craniofacial morphology. As these findings in CNP-KO rats are similar to those in patients with achondroplasia, treatment with CNP-53 or a CNP analog may be able to restore craniofacial morphology and foramen magnum size as well as short stature.
