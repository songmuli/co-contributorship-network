Utility of serum Aspergillus-galactomannan antigen to evaluate the risk of severe acute exacerbation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
  Background  Recent studies have shown that the microbiome, namely Aspergillus species, play a previously unrecognized role in both stable and exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Galactomannan is a major component of the Aspergillus cell wall that has been widely used as a diagnostic marker.    Objectives  To explore whether serum levels of Aspergillus -galactomannan antigen could be used to evaluate the risk of severe acute exacerbation of COPD (AE-COPD).    Methods  We measured the Aspergillus -galactomannan antigen levels of 191 patients with stable COPD, and examined its clinical relevance including AE-COPD.    Results  There were 77 (40.3%) patients who were positive for serum Aspergillus -galactomannan antigen (≥0.5). High Aspergillus -galactomannan antigen level (≥0.7) was associated with older age and presence of bronchiectasis and cysts on computed tomography images. Compared to patients with low Aspergillus -galactomannan antigen level (<0.7), patients with high Aspergillus -galactomannan antigen level had significantly higher incidence of severe AE-COPD ( P = 0.0039, Gray’s test) and respiratory-related mortality ( P = 0.0176, log-rank test). Multivariate analysis showed that high Aspergillus -galactomannan antigen level was independently associated with severe AE-COPD (hazard ratio, 2.162; 95% confidence interval, 1.267−3.692; P = 0.005).    Conclusion  Serum Aspergillus -galactomannan antigen was detected in patients with COPD, and elevated serum Aspergillus -galactomannan antigen was associated with severe AE-COPD.
