Prognostic factors and outcomes in Japanese lung transplant candidates with interstitial lung disease
  Objective  Young patients with advanced interstitial lung disease (ILD) are potential candidates for cadaveric lung transplantation. This study aimed to examine clinical features, outcomes, and prognostic factors in Japanese ILD patients awaiting lung transplantation.    Methods  We investigated the clinical features and outcomes of 77 consecutive candidates with ILD who were referred to Kyoto University Hospital and subsequently actively listed for lung transplant in the Japan Organ Transplant Network between 2010 and 2014.    Results  Of the 77 candidates, 33 had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 15 had unclassifiable ILD. During the observational period, 23 patients (30%) received lung transplantations and 49 patients (64%) died before transplantation. Of the 33 patients with IPF, 13 (39%) had a family history of ILD and 13 (39%) had an “inconsistent with usual interstitial pneumonia pattern” on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). The median survival time from registration was 16.7 months, and mortality was similar among patients with IPF, unclassifiable ILD, and other ILDs. Using a multivariate stepwise Cox proportional hazards model, 6-min walking distance was shown to be an independent prognostic factor in candidates with ILD (per 10 m, hazard ratio (HR): 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95–0.99, p<0.01), while lower body mass index (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.72–0.95, p < 0.01) independently contributed to mortality in patients with IPF.    Conclusions  Japanese patients with ILD awaiting transplantation had very poor outcomes regardless of their specific diagnosis. A substantial percentage of IPF patients had an atypical HRCT pattern. 6-min walking distance in ILD patients and body mass index in IPF patients were independent predictors of mortality.
