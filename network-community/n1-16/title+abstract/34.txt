Suboptimal infant and young child feeding practices in rural Boucle du Mouhoun, Burkina Faso: Findings from a cross-sectional population-based survey
  Introduction  In Burkina Faso in 2016, 27% and 8% of children under-5 were estimated to suffer from stunting and wasting respectively. Here, we report on infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices in rural areas of the Boucle du Mouhoun region.    Materials and methods  A cross-sectional population-based survey was performed in 2017 in a representative sample of mothers of children aged 6 to 23 months. IYCF practices were assessed using 24-hour dietary recall. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of IYCF practices. All analyses accounted for sampling stratification by child’s age group and for data clustering.    Results  According to mothers’ reports, 60% (95%CI 55, 65%) of children received the minimum meal frequency, but only 18% (95%CI 15, 22%) and 13% (95%CI 10, 16%) benefited from the minimum dietary diversity and the minimum acceptable diet respectively. Only 16% (95%CI 13, 20%) of mothers reported increasing breastfeeding or liquids and continued feeding during an episode of child illness. Knowledge of timely introduction of complementary foods and recommended feeding practices during an illness were low. Despite positive attitudes towards the introduction of key food groups, mother’s perceived self-efficacy to provide children with these food groups every day was relatively low.    Discussion  Our findings highlight the need for interventions to improve mothers’ knowledge and practices in relation to IYCF in the Boucle du Mouhoun region. Behaviour change communication strategies have the potential to improve IYCF indicators but should be tailored to the local context. The high attendance of health facilities for preventive well-baby consultations represents an opportunity for contact with caretakers that should be exploited for promotion and child growth monitoring.
