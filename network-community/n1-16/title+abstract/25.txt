What has reproductive health decision-making capacity got to do with unintended pregnancy? Evidence from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey
  Introduction  Women’s reproductive health decision-making is indispensable for improving their reproductive health and achieving Sustainable Development Goal three. This study explored the association between reproductive health decision-making capacity and unintended pregnancy among women in Ghana.    Materials and methods  We used data from the 2014 version of the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. The unit of analysis for this study was pregnant women at the time of the survey (679). Bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted using Pearson chi-square tests and binary logistic regression respectively.    Results  We found that women who had the capacity to make reproductive health decision [AOR = 0.61; CI = 0.51–0.89] were less likely to experience unintended pregnancies, compared to those who did not have the capacity. Age was found to have a statistically significant influence on unintended pregnancy, with women aged 25–29 years [AOR = 0.29; CI = 0.13–0.63], 30–34 years [AOR = 0.18; CI = 0.08–0.45], and 35–39 years [AOR = 0.26; CI = 0.10–0.68] being less likely to experience unintended pregnancy compared to those aged 15–19 years. Women with primary level of education were more likely to have unintended pregnancies, compared to those with no education [AOR = 2.07; CI = 1.12–3.84].    Conclusion  This study has filled the gap in the already existing literature on the association between reproductive health decision making capacity and unintended pregnancy in Ghana and has created a room for specific interventions geared towards reducing unintended pregnancies, especially among women who are not capable of making reproductive health decisions, women aged 15–19 years, those with primary education, Traditionalists and unmarried women.
