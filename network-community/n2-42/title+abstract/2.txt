Correlations of left ventricular systolic function indices with aortic root systolic excursion (ARSE): A cross-sectional echocardiographic study
  Background  Heart failure (HF), is a major public health issue globally. Echocardiography is cost–effective in the diagnosis in expert hands. This study was conducted to estimate the usefulness of Aortic Root Systolic Excursion (ARSE) as a simple and accurate measure to estimate Left Ventricular (LV) function.    Methods  This was a cross-sectional echocardiographic study among adults aged ≥ 18 years, with or without heart failure, in sinus rhythm, and with no LV out–let obstruction. We studied the correlations of ARSE with some selected indices of LV Systolic Functions. We determined optimal cut–offs of ARSE in detecting LV dysfunction. We generated a simple regression equation to best estimate LV ejection fraction according to the modified Simpson method.    Results  Overall 213 echocardiograms were included from 106 males (49.8%), with mean age of the participants being 52.4 (SD: 18.3) years. The rate of LV systolic dysfunction was highest with Teicholz method (17.4%) and lowest with MAPSE method (5.2%). ARSE correlated with the LV functions. This was highest for the Simpson method (r = 0.619, p<0.001), and lowest for the ITV method (r = 0.319, p<0.001). Optimal cut-offs to detect LV systolic dysfunction was ≈ 6.6 mm. For an LV ejection fraction < 55%, the sensitivity was 82.9%, and the specificity was 97.2%, with an AUROC of 91.6%.The logarithmic regression equation was best in predicting LV ejection fraction (AUC: 60.2%), followed by the power model (AUC: 56.7%), and the linear model (AUC: 53.6%).    Conclusion  ARSE correlated well with LV systolic function. The cut–off ≤ 6.5 mm suggest LV systolic dysfunction. LV Ejection Fraction was best estimated with the generic equation: LVEF (%) = 29 x In [ARSE].
