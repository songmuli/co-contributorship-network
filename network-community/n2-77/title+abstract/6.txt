Diagnostic performance and image quality of iterative model-based reconstruction of coronary CT angiography using 100 kVp for heavily calcified coronary vessels
  Objectives  To evaluate the diagnostic performance and image quality of an iterative model-based reconstruction (IMR) using a 100-kVp protocol for the assessment of heavily calcified coronary vessels, compared to those of filtered back projection (FBP) and hybrid iterative technique (iDose 4 ), and also compared to those of IMR with standard 120 kVp protocol.    Methods  Among patients with Agatston scores â‰¥ 400 who had undergone both coronary CT angiography (CCTA) and invasive coronary angiography (ICA), age- and sex-matched patients with body mass index < 30 were retrospectively enrolled from CCTA with low-kVp protocol (100 kVp, n = 30) and with standard-kVp protocol (120 kVp, n = 30). Image data were all reconstructed with FBP, iDose 4 , and IMR. In each dataset, the objective and subjective image quality, and diagnostic accuracy (> 50% in luminal reduction as compared with ICA) were assessed.    Results  IMR showed better objective and subjective image quality than FBP and iDose 4 in both 100 kVp and 120 kVp groups (all p < 0.05). IMR showed a significantly improved all diagnostic performance compared with FBP (p < 0.05). Compared with iDose 4 , IMR significantly improved positive predictive value (85.0% vs. 80.5%; p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in image quality and diagnostic performance using IMR between the 100 kVp and 120 kVp groups.    Conclusions  100 kVp IMR may be useful for the assessment of heavily calcified coronary vessels, providing better diagnostic performance than FBP or iDose 4 at the same dose, while maintaining similar diagnostic accuracy to 120 kVp IMR.
