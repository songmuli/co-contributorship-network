Use of the revised World Health Organization cluster survey methodology to classify measles-rubella vaccination campaign coverage in 47 counties in Kenya, 2016
  Introduction  To achieve measles elimination, two doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) are provided through routine immunization services or vaccination campaigns. In May 2016, Kenya conducted a measles-rubella (MR) vaccination campaign targeting 19 million children aged 9 months–14 years, with a goal of achieving ≥95% coverage. We conducted a post-campaign cluster survey to estimate national coverage and classify coverage in Kenya’s 47 counties.    Methods  The stratified multi-stage cluster survey included data from 20,011 children in 8,253 households sampled using the recently revised World Health Organization coverage survey methodology (2015). Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of national campaign coverage were calculated, accounting for study design. County vaccination coverage was classified as ‘pass,’ ‘fail,’ or ‘intermediate,’ using one-sided hypothesis tests against a 95% threshold.    Results  Estimated national MR campaign coverage was 95% (95% CI: 94%-96%). Coverage differed significantly (p < 0.05) by child’s school attendance, mother’s education, household wealth, and other factors. In classifying coverage, 20 counties passed (≥95%), two failed (<95%), and 25 were intermediate (unable to classify either way). Reported campaign awareness among caretakers was 92%. After the 2016 MR campaign, an estimated 93% (95% CI: 92%–94%) of children aged 9 months to 14 years had received ≥2 MCV doses; 6% (95% CI: 6%–7%) had 1 MCV dose; and 0.7% (95% CI: 0.6%–0.9%) remained unvaccinated.    Conclusions  Kenya reached the MR campaign target of 95% vaccination coverage, representing a substantial achievement towards increasing population immunity. High campaign awareness reflected the comprehensive social mobilization strategy implemented in Kenya and supports the importance of including strong communications platforms in future vaccination campaigns. In counties with sub-optimal MR campaign coverage, further efforts are needed to increase MCV coverage to achieve the national goal of measles elimination by 2020.
