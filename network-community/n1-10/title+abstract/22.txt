Baseline predictors of antiretroviral treatment failure and lost to follow up in a multicenter countrywide HIV-1 cohort study in Ethiopia
  Background  Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been rapidly scaled up in Ethiopia since 2005, but factors influencing the outcome are poorly studied. We therefore analysed baseline predictors of first-line ART outcome after 6 and 12 months.    Material and methods  874 HIV-infected patients, who started first-line ART, were enrolled in a countrywide prospective cohort. Two outcomes were defined: i) treatment failure: detectable viremia or lost-to-follow-up (LTFU) (confirmed death, moved from study sites or similar reasons); ii) LTFU only. Using stepwise logistic regression, four multivariable models identified baseline predictors for odds of treatment failure and LTFU.    Results  The treatment failure rates were 23.3% and 33.9% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Opportunistic infections (OI), tuberculosis (TB), CD4 cells <50/μl, and viral load >5 log10 copies/ml increased the odds of treatment failure both at 6 and 12 months. The odds of LTFU at month 6 increased with baseline functional disabilities, WHO stage III/IV, and CD4 cells <50/μl. TB also increased the odds at month 12. Importantly, ART outcome differed across hospitals. Compared to the national hospital in Addis Ababa, patients from most regional sites had higher odds of treatment failure and/or LTFU at month 6 and/or 12, with the exception of one clinic (Jimma), which had lower odds of failure at month 6.    Conclusions  In this first countrywide Ethiopian HIV cohort, a high ART failure rate was identified, to the largest extent due to LTFU, including death. The geographical region where the patients were treated was a strong baseline predictor of ART failure. The difference in ART outcome across hospitals calls the need for provision of more national support at regional level.
