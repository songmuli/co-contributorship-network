Monitoring the transition to new antiretroviral treatment regimens through an enhanced data system in Kenya
  Background  While the scale-up of HIV services has improved national health management information systems (HMIS), there remain challenges in using routine data to guide the introduction of optimized antiretroviral (ARV) drugs.    Methods  Building on the recent enhancements to the HMIS in Kenya and coinciding with the introduction of a new ARV regimen, tenofovir+lamivudine+dolutegravir (TLD), we developed and implemented an enhanced data system (EDS) to improve availability of safety and efficacy data among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Kenya. Using data from one health facility, we showcase how the EDS can be used to monitor ARV transition and identify missed opportunities to transition eligible patients to optimized regimes.    Results  The EDS was designed to create a comprehensive PLHIV database by triangulating patient-level data from the EMR, the pharmacy ARV dispensing tool (ADT) and HIV viral load (VL) databases. On a monthly basis, the database is de-identified and uploaded into a national data warehouse, with interactive dashboards. Using the EDS, we determined that of the 5,500 PLHIV â‰¥15 years on first-line ART at one facility, 4,233 (77%) had transitioned to optimized ARVs. Of the 1,267 still on legacy regimens, 459 (36%) were determined to be eligible and prioritized to switch.    Conclusions  This project illustrates how enhancements to the national HMIS can facilitate the use of routine patient-level data to monitor the transition to new ARVs and inform the national HIV response.
