Association between leukocyte telomere length and the risk of pancreatic cancer: Findings from a prospective study
  Introduction  Telomeres and telomerase play important role in maintaining chromosome integrity and genomic stability. Recent epidemiologic data showed inconsistent findings which suggested that both short and long leukocyte telomeres could be associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer. We prospectively examined the association between telomere length and pancreatic cancer risk in a population-based cohort study.    Methods  The Singapore Chinese Health Study recruited 63,257 Chinese aged 45 to 74 years from 1993 to 1998 in Singapore. Relative telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes was quantified using a validated monochrome multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction method in 26,540 participants, including 116 participants who later developed pancreatic cancer after an average of 13 years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazard regression method was used to calculate hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) of pancreatic cancer risk associated with telomere length, with adjustment for confounding factors.    Results  Longer telomeres were significantly associated with higher risk of pancreatic cancer ( P trend = 0.02). Compared with lowest quartile, subjects with highest quartile of telomere length had an HR of 2.18 (95% CI: 1.25–3.80) for developing pancreatic cancer. In stratified analysis, this association remained among pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients but not among pancreatic non-adenocarcinoma patients. In continuous scale, the HRs and 95% CIs were 3.08 (1.17–8.11) for adenocarcinoma patients and 1.47 (0.43–5.06) for non-adenocarcinoma patients. The HRs and 95% CIs of the highest quartile of telomere length, compared with the lowest quartile, for adenocarcinoma and non-adenocarcinoma were 2.50 (1.22–5.13) and 1.63 (0.66–4.03), respectively. The length of follow-up from the collection of blood for the measurement of telomere length to the diagnosis of cancer (median = 8.0, range: from 5.0 months to 16.2 years) had no significant impact on the association between telomere length and pancreatic cancer risk.    Conclusions  The present study demonstrates that longer telomeres are associated with increased risk of overall pancreatic cancer.
