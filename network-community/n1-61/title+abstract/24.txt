Early hematoma retraction in intracerebral hemorrhage is uncommon and does not predict outcome
  Background  Clot retraction in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has been described and postulated to be related to effective hemostasis and perihematoma edema (PHE) formation. The incidence and quantitative extent of hematoma retraction (HR) is unknown. Our aim was to determine the incidence of HR between baseline and time of admission. We also tested the hypothesis that patients with HR had higher PHE volume and good prognosis.    Methods  This was a retrospective single-centre study in which serial planimetric volume measurements of the total hematoma volume (parenchymal (IPH) and intraventricular (IVH)) and PHE were performed in ICH patients with baseline non-contrast computed tomography (CT) completed within 6 hours of onset and follow-up CT 24 (±12) hours from symptom onset. HR was defined as a decrease in volume of >3ml or >15%, and hematoma expansion (HE) as an increase of >6ml or >30%. All other patients were categorized as stable hematoma (HS). Good outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0–2 at 90 days.    Results  A total of 136 patients (mean age = 69.3±13.39 years, 58.1% male) were included. Median (interquartile range) baseline total hematoma volume was 14.96 (7.80, 31.88) ml. HR >3ml and >15% occurred in 6 (4.4%) and 8 (5.9%) patients, respectively. Neither definition of HR was associated with follow-up PHE (p>0.297) or good outcome (p>0.249). IVH was the only independent predictor of HR (p<0.0241).    Conclusions  Early HR is rare and associated with IVH, but not with PHE or clinical outcome. There was no relationship between HR, PHE, and patient prognosis. Therefore, HR is unlikely to be a useful endpoint in clinical ICH studies.
