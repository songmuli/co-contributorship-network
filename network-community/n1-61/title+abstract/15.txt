The shifting epidemiology and serotype distribution of invasive pneumococcal disease in Ontario, Canada, 2007-2017
  Background  Ontario, Canada introduced a publicly-funded 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) for infants in 2010, replacing the 10-valent (PCV10, 2009–2010) and the 7-valent (PCV7, 2005–2009) conjugate vaccine programs; a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) has been available for older adults since 1996. We examined the epidemiology and serotype distribution of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in Ontario in the context of provincial immunization programs.    Methods  We included confirmed IPD cases reported in Ontario between 2007 and 2017. We grouped serotypes according to Ontario’s current immunization program (PCV13, PPV23, and non-vaccine-preventable) and calculated incidence rates (per 100,000 population) using population data.    Results  Between 2007 and 2017, annual incidence of IPD in Ontario ranged between 7.3 and 9.7/100,000 per year. Measures of illness severity were high throughout the period of surveillance. After PCV13 program implementation in 2010, incidence due to PCV13 serotypes decreased significantly across all age groups, with the greatest reductions in children <5 years and adults ≥65 years. Conversely, incidence due to PPV23 unique serotypes increased significantly between 2007 and 2017, with the greatest increases observed in adults 50–64 years (1.4 to 3.5/100,000) and ≥65 years (2.3 to 7.2/100,000). Similar increases were observed in incidence due to non-vaccine-preventable serotypes among all age groups, except infants <1 year. Within specific serotypes, incidence due to serotypes 3 (0.42 to 0.98/100,000) and 22F (0.31 to 0.72/100,000) increased significantly between 2007 and 2017, while incidence due to serotypes 19A and 7F decreased significantly during the PCV13 period (2010–2017).    Conclusions  Eight years after PCV13 implementation in Ontario, our data suggest both direct and indirect effects on serotype-specific incidence in young children and older adults. However, overall provincial rates have remained unchanged, and IPD continues to be a severe burden on the population. The rising incidence of IPD due to PPV23 unique and non-vaccine-preventable serotypes, and the growing burden of serotypes 3 and 22F, require further study.
