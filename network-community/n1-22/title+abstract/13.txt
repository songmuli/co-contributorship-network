Real-world efficacy of direct acting antiviral therapies in patients with HIV/HCV
 The advent of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies has dramatically transformed HCV treatment, with most recent trials demonstrating high efficacy rates (>90%) across all genotypes and special populations, including patients with HIV/HCV coinfection. The efficacy rates of HCV treatment are nearly identical between patients with HCV monofection and patients with HIV/HCV coinfection; however, there are limited studies to compare real-world efficacy with efficacy observed in clinical trials. Using a database from HIV clinics across the United States (US), we identified 432 patients with HIV/HCV coinfection who completed DAA therapy from January 1, 2014 to March 31, 2017 and were assessed for efficacy. Efficacy was evaluated as sustained virologic response (SVR) 12 weeks after DAA completion; furthermore, factors associated with achieving SVR12 were identified. In this analysis, we found DAA therapies to be effective, with 94% of the patients achieving SVR12 and 6% experiencing virologic failure. Baseline variables, including older age, HCV viral load <800K IU/ML, FIB-4 score <1.45, absence of depression, diabetes, substance abuse, and use of DAA regimens without ribavirin were significant predictors of achieving SVR12. Patients with fewer comorbidities, better liver health, and lower HCV viral loads at baseline were more likely to achieve treatment success. Our results were consistent with other real-world studies, supporting the use of HCV therapy in HIV/HCV coinfected patients.
