Meta-analysis of the radiological and clinical features of Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) and Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP)
  Purpose  To conduct a meta-analysis to determine specific computed tomography (CT) patterns and clinical features that discriminate between nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).    Materials and methods  The PubMed/Medline and Embase databases were searched for studies describing the radiological patterns of UIP and NSIP in chest CT images. Only studies involving histologically confirmed diagnoses and a consensus diagnosis by an interstitial lung disease (ILD) board were included in this analysis. The radiological patterns and patient demographics were extracted from suitable articles. We used random-effects meta-analysis by DerSimonian & Laird and calculated pooled odds ratios for binary data and pooled mean differences for continuous data.    Results  Of the 794 search results, 33 articles describing 2,318 patients met the inclusion criteria. Twelve of these studies included both NSIP (338 patients) and UIP (447 patients). NSIP-patients were significantly younger (NSIP: median age 54.8 years, UIP: 59.7 years; mean difference (MD) -4.4; p = 0.001; 95% CI: -6.97 to -1.77), less often male (NSIP: median 52.8%, UIP: 73.6%; pooled odds ratio (OR) 0.32; p<0.001; 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.60), and less often smokers (NSIP: median 55.1%, UIP: 73.9%; OR 0.42; p = 0.005; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.77) than patients with UIP. The CT findings from patients with NSIP revealed significantly lower levels of the honeycombing pattern (NSIP: median 28.9%, UIP: 73.4%; OR 0.07; p<0.001; 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.30) with less peripheral predominance (NSIP: median 41.8%, UIP: 83.3%; OR 0.21; p<0.001; 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.38) and more subpleural sparing (NSIP: median 40.7%, UIP: 4.3%; OR 16.3; p = 0.005; 95% CI: 2.28 to 117).    Conclusion  Honeycombing with a peripheral predominance was significantly associated with a diagnosis of UIP. The NSIP pattern showed more subpleural sparing. The UIP pattern was predominantly observed in elderly males with a history of smoking, whereas NSIP occurred in a younger patient population.
