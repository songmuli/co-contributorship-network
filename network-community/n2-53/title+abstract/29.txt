Impact of peripheral artery disease on short-term outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention: A report from Japanese nationwide registry
 Atherosclerosis is a systemic process. As the population ages, increasingly more patients who undergo coronary revascularization are complicated with peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, the large body of evidence in this area has not been limited to analysis from trial-based data from younger and relatively uncomplicated patients in Western countries. The impact of PAD on the outcomes can differ by patient characteristics, and integrated analysis of large-scale data is necessary. J-PCI is a universal (all-comer) nationwide registration system in Japan, regulated and audited by professional society that controls national board-certification system. For the present study, we extracted data of 894,014 percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) cases performed between 2014 and 2017 (mean age 70.2 years [standard deviation 11.0]). In-hospital outcomes of PAD and Non-PAD patients were compared. PAD was defined as a previous history of stenosis of peripheral arteries or abdominal aortic aneurysm. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and multivariable modeling was performed. A total of 66,891 patients (8.1%) had PAD. Crude in-hospital mortality rate was higher in this group (0.99% vs. 0.67% in Non-PAD group). PAD was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.383 [95% confidence interval 1.251–1.528]). However, the impact of PAD differed by kidney condition (OR 1.578 [1.370–1.821] for patients with chronic kidney disease [CKD] and OR 1.234 [1.076–1.416] without CKD: P for interaction 0.005), and by clinical presentation: PAD was not associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing PCI for silent ischemia (OR 1.211 [0.8701–1.685]: P for interaction 0.002). Presence of PAD was independently associated with in-hospital mortality in patients receiving PCI. However, its impact varied substantially by the patient background or indication of the procedure.
