Progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy assessed by serial three-vessel quantitative coronary angiography
  Background  The purpose of the present study was to assess the short- and long-term progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) using serial 3-vessel quantitative coronary angiography (QCA).    Methods  CAV progression was assessed using serial 3-vessel QCA analysis at baseline, 1-year and long-term angiographic follow-up (8.5±3.7 years) after heart transplantation. The change in minimal lumen diameter (MLD) and percent diameter stenosis (%DS) was serially assessed within matched segments. Patients were graded according to the ISHLT-CAV classification and grouped as ISHLT-CAV 0 and ISHLT-CAV 1-3 . The primary endpoint was mean change in MLD and %DS.    Results  A total of 41 patients and 520 matched segments were available for serial 3-vessel QCA. Overall, MLD decreased non-significantly from baseline to 1-year follow-up and significantly from 1-year to the long-term angiographic follow-up (Δ-0.08mm/year [95%CI -0.11 to -0.05], P<0.001). %DS increased significantly from baseline to 1-year (Δ+0.96%/year [95%CI 0.04 to 1.88], P = 0.041) and from 1-year to long-term angiographic follow-up (Δ+0.61%/year [95%CI 0.33 to 0.88], P<0.001). ISHLT-CAV 1-3 at 1 year and at long-term angiographic follow-up was observed in 22% and 61%, respectively. Between baseline and long-term angiographic follow-up, a significant reduction in MLD was observed within both groups without a significant difference in the reduction between the two groups (ISHLT-CAV 0 : median -0.49mm [IQR -0.54 to -0.43] vs. ISHLT-CAV 1-3 : median -0.40mm [IQR -0.44 to -0.35], P = 0.4).    Conclusion  The current data suggest that QCA can’t predict CAV beyond 1 year, but, QCA affirmed that CAV progresses to a similar extent in patients who do not develop visual CAV during long-term follow-up.
