Field evaluation of HIV point-of-care testing for early infant diagnosis in Cape Town, South Africa
  Background  Early infant HIV diagnosis (EID) coverage and uptake remains challenging. Point-of-care (POC) testing may improve access and turn-around-times, but, while several POC technologies are in development there are few data on their implementation in the field.    Methods  We conducted an implementation study of the Alere q Detect POC system for EID at two public sector health facilities in Cape Town. HIV-exposed neonates undergoing routine EID testing at a large maternity hospital and a primary care clinic received both laboratory-based HIV PCR testing per local protocols and a POC test. We analysed the performance of POC versus laboratory testing, and conducted semi-structured interviews with providers to assess acceptability and implementation issues.    Results  Overall 478 specimens were taken: 311 tests were performed at the obstetric hospital (median child age, 1 days) and 167 six-week tests in primary care (median child age, 42 days). 9.0% of all tests resulted in an error with no differences by site; most errors resolved with retesting. POC was more sensitive (100%; lower 95% CI, 39.8%) and specific (100%, lower 95% CI, 98%) among older children tested in primary care compared with birth testing in hospital (90.0%, 95% CI, 55.5â€“99.8% and 100.0%, lower 95% CI, 98.4%, respectively). Negative predictive value was high (>99%) at both sites. In interviews, providers felt the device was simple to use and facilitated decision-making in the management of infants. However, many wanted clarity on the cause of errors on the POC device to help guide repeat testing.    Conclusions  POC EID testing performs well in field implementation in health care facilities and appears highly acceptable to health care providers.
