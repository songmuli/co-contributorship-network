Prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis among prison inmates: A cross-sectional survey at the Correctional and Detention Facility of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire
  Background  In Côte d’Ivoire, a TB prison program has been developed since 1999. This program includes offering TB screening to prisoners who show up with TB symptoms at the infirmary. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of pulmonary TB among inmates at the Correctional and Detention Facility of Abidjan, the largest prison of Côte d’Ivoire, 16 years after this TB program was implemented.    Methods  Between March and September 2015, inmates, were screened for pulmonary TB using systematic direct smear microscopy, culture and chest X-ray. All participants were also proposed HIV testing. TB was defined as either confirmed (positive culture), probable (positive microscopy and/or chest X-ray findings suggestive of TB) or possible (signs or symptoms suggestive of TB, no X-Ray or microbiological evidence). Factors associated with confirmed tuberculosis were analysed using multivariable logistic regression.    Results  Among the 943 inmates screened, 88 (9.3%) met the TB case definition, including 19 (2.0%) with confirmed TB, 40 (4.2%) with probable TB and 29 (3.1%) with possible TB. Of the 19 isolated TB strains, 10 (53%) were TB drug resistant, including 7 (37%) with multi-resistance. Of the 10 patients with TB resistant strain, only one had a past history of TB treatment. HIV prevalence was 3.1% overall, and 9.6%among TB cases. Factors associated with confirmed TB were age ≥30 years (Odds Ratio 3.8; 95% CI 1.1–13.3), prolonged cough (Odds Ratio 3.6; 95% CI 1.3–9.5) and fever (Odds Ratio 2.7; 95% CI 1.0–7.5).    Conclusion  In the country largest prison, pulmonary TB is still 10 (confirmed) to 44 times (confirmed, probable or possible) as frequent as in the Côte d’Ivoire general population, despite a long-time running symptom-based program of TB detection. Decreasing TB prevalence and limiting the risk of MDR may require the implementation of annual in-cell TB screening campaigns that systematically target all prison inmates.
