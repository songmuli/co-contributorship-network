Neurodevelopment of HIV-exposed uninfected children in Cape Town, South Africa
  Background  Evidence shows that antiretroviral (ART) exposure is associated with neurodevelopmental delays in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-exposed uninfected (HEU) children. However, there are few insights into modifiable maternal and child factors that may play a role in improving neurodevelopment in HEU children. We used a parent-centric neurodevelopment tool, Ages & Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) to examined neurodevelopment in HEU children at 12–24 months of age, and associations with maternal and child factors.    Methods  505 HIV-infected women (initiated ART pre- or during pregnancy) with live singleton births attending primary health care were enrolled; 355 of their HEU children were assessed for neurodevelopment (gross motor, fine motor, communication, problem solving and personal-social domains) at 12–24 months using age-specific ASQ administered by a trained fieldworker. Associations with maternal and child factors were examined using logistic regression models.    Results  Among mothers (median age 30 years, IQR, 26–34), 52% initiated ART during pregnancy; the median CD4 count was 436 cells/μl (IQR, 305–604). Most delayed neurodevelopment in HEU children was in gross (9%) and fine motor (5%) functions. In adjusted models, maternal socio-economic status (aOR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24–0.76) was associated with reduced odds of delayed gross-fine motor neurodevelopment. Maternal age ≥35 years (aOR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05–0.89) and maternal body mass index (BMI) <18.5 (aOR 6.76, 95% CI 1.06–43.13) were associated with delayed communication-problem-solving-personal-social neurodevelopment. There were no differences in odds for either domain by maternal ART initiation timing.    Conclusions  Delayed neurodevelopment was detected in both gross and fine motor functions in this cohort of HEU children, with strong maternal predictors that may be explored as potentially modifiable factors associated with neurodevelopment at one to two years of age.
