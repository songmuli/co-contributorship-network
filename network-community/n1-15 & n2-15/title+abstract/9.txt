Combined neutralization of interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha induces IL-4 production but has no direct additive impact on parasite burden in splenic cultures of human visceral leishmaniasis
 Immune activating cytokines Interferon (IFN)-γ and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α are known to activate macrophages for killing of Leishmania parasite. IFN-γ provides therapeutic potential while TNF-α has been recognized to mediate protection in visceral model of infection. In the present study we investigated whether combination of IFN-γ and TNF-α has better therapeutic strength than individually using one of these cytokines in Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) patients. We performed combined blockade of IFN-γ and TNF-α in VL splenic biopsies and demonstrated it’s impact on number of viable amastigotes and cytokine production. Additionally, selective depletion of splenic cell subsets was performed to establish the cellular sources of IFN-γ and TNF-α. Treatment of splenic aspirate cells with combination of anti-IFN-γ and anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibodies for 72 hours enabled no direct additive impact of these cytokines on parasite replication and IL-10 secretion, but IL-4 production was induced. Further assessment of splenic biopsies put forward CD4 + T cells as a source of IFN-γ whereas CD14 + cells contribute towards TNF-α production. Overall our results suggest, the interplay of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ derived from CD4 + T lymphocytes and TNF-α from CD14 + cells has no direct additive impact on parasite replication but induces IL-4 production. Our data does not support direct targeting of IFN-γ and TNF-α for combination therapy but targeting these cytokines as an adjuvant in patients with exaggerated tissue inflammatory responses can have favourable patient outcome.
