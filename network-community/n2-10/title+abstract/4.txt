Association between the retinal vascular network and retinal nerve fiber layer in the elderly: The Montrachet study
  Purpose  To investigate the association between the characteristics of the retinal vascular network in the elderly and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in a population-based study.    Methods  We conducted a population-based study, the Montrachet study (Maculopathy Optic Nerve, nuTRition neurovAsCular, and HEarT disease), in participants aged ≥ 75 years. RNFL thickness was assessed with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Analysis of the retinal vascular network was performed by means of the Singapore “I” Vessel Assessment (SIVA) software based on fundus photography.    Results  Data from 970 participants were suitable for analysis. Patients with optic neuropathy were excluded. In multivariable analysis, each standard deviation (SD) decrease in the caliber of the six largest arterioles and veins in zone B and the six largest arterioles and veins in zone C was associated with a decrease in global RNFL thickness (β = −1.62 μm, P = 0.001; β = −2.39 μm, P < 0.001; β = −1.56 μm, P = 0.002; and β = −2.64 μm, P < 0.001, respectively).    Conclusions  Our study found that decreased retinal vessels caliber were associated with a decreased RNFL thickness in the elderly without optic neuropathy.
