Annual trends in arthroscopic meniscus surgery: Analysis of a national database in Japan
  Background  The importance of meniscus preservation is widely recognized. There have been a few studies describing trends in meniscectomy and meniscus repair in the United States; however, they presented differing results. We reported annual trends in meniscus surgery, using a national database in Japan.    Methods  We interrogated the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, which represents approximately half of all hospital admissions in Japan. We included the patients who underwent meniscectomy and meniscus repair between July 2007 and March 2015. The diagnosis, age and sex of each patient were recorded.    Results  We identified 83,105 patients: 69,310 underwent meniscectomy; 13,416 underwent meniscus repair and 379 underwent both in a single admission. The proportion of patients undergoing meniscus repair rose from 7.0% in 2007 to 25.9% in 2014 (p < 0.001), while the proportion undergoing meniscectomy fell from 92.8% in 2007 to 73.3% in 2014 (p < 0.001). Among patients under 30 years old, the proportions undergoing meniscus repair or meniscectomy in 2014 were 50.3% versus 48.3%, respectively. A bimodal age distribution was observed for meniscectomy, with peaks at 10–19 years of age and 60–69 years of age, whereas most patients undergoing meniscus repair were 10–19 years of age.    Conclusions  We found characteristic trends where the popularity of meniscus repair increased rapidly at the expense of meniscectomy in Japan during the study period. In the last survey year, the proportion of meniscus repair exceeded that of meniscectomy in those younger than 30 years. Meniscectomy was undertaken most often in adolescents and early old age, while meniscus repair was undertaken most often in adolescents.
