Development of a risk prediction model for infection-related mortality in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis
  Background  Assessment of infection-related mortality remains inadequate in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. This study was performed to develop a risk model for predicting the 2-year infection-related mortality risk in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.    Methods  The study cohort comprised 606 patients who started and continued peritoneal dialysis for 90 at least days and was drawn from the Fukuoka Peritoneal Dialysis Database Registry Study in Japan. The patients were registered from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2016 and followed up until 31 December 2017. To generate a prediction rule, the score for each variable was weighted by the regression coefficients calculated using a Cox proportional hazard model adjusted by risk factors for infection-related mortality, including patient characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory data.    Results  During the follow-up period (median, 2.2 years), 138 patients died; 58 of them of infectious disease. The final model for infection-related mortality comprises six factors: age, sex, serum albumin, serum creatinine, total cholesterol, and weekly renal Kt/V. The incidence of infection-related mortality increased linearly with increasing total risk score (P for trend <0.001). Furthermore, the prediction model showed adequate discrimination (c-statistic = 0.79 [0.72–0.86]) and calibration (Hosmer–Lemeshow test, P = 0.47).    Conclusion  In this study, we developed a new model using clinical measures for predicting infection-related mortality in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.
