Estimated 24-hour urinary sodium excretion as a risk factor for oxidative stress in Zambian adults: A cross-sectional study
  Introduction  Persistent oxidative stress predisposes to various non-communicable diseases (NCDs), whose occurrence is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to evaluate the link between markers of oxidative stress and some risk factors for NCDs in a Zambian cohort.    Methods  We assessed oxidative stress by measuring 8-isoprostane (lipid oxidative stress) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (DNA oxidative stress). In addition, we measured mycotoxins (aflatoxin M1 and ochratoxin A), salt intake estimated from 24-hour sodium excretion calculated using the Tanaka and Kawaski formulae, and 1-hydroxypyrene (a metabolite of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). Data on lifestyle risk factors were collected using questionnaires.    Results  Included were 244 participants; 128 (52%) were female and the median age was 48 years (IQR 39–58). The median level of 8-isoprostane was 0.13 ng/mg creatinine (IQR 0.08–0.23) while that of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was 4 ng/mg creatinine (IQR 2–10). The median 24-hour sodium excretion was 21 g (IQR 16–25 g), with none being less than the 5 g recommended by WHO. Unadjusted urinary levels of 8-isoprostane were moderately correlated with 1-hydroxypyrene (Spearman r = 0.30, p <0.001) and estimated 24-hour urine sodium (Spearman r = 0.38, p <0.001). Urinary levels of 8-OHdG were not correlated with 1-hydroxypyrene, estimated 24-hour urine sodium, aflatoxin M1 or ochratoxin A (all p -values >0.05). Using logistic regression, adjusted and unadjusted 8-isoprostanes levels were associated with 1-hydroxypyrene ( p = 0.02 and p = 0.001 respectively) and estimated 24-hour urine sodium method ( p = 0.003 and p <0.001 respectively). However, only unadjusted 8-OHdG was associated with 1-hydroxypyrene ( p = 0.03) and age ( p = 0.007).    Conclusions  Estimated 24-hour urinary sodium is high among Zambians and it is associated with lipid but not DNA oxidative stress. High exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is also associated with oxidative stress.
