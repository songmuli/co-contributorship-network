Four months vitamin D supplementation to vitamin D insufficient individuals does not improve muscular strength: A randomized controlled trial
  Main objective  The inconsistent results on the effects of vitamin D on muscle strength reported by intervention trials may partly be explained by inclusion of vitamin D sufficient individuals. The main objective was to study whether vitamin D supplementation will improve muscle strength in men and women with low serum vitamin D status, as measured by 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) at baseline.    Methods  417 men and women aged 40–80 years were included and randomized to receive a loading dose of 100 000 IU (2500 ug) vitamin D 3 followed by 20 000 IU (500 ug)/week, or placebo. Muscle strength was tested by dynamometers at baseline and after four months.    Results  Serum 25(OH)D levels increased from 32.6±11.1 nmol/l to 88.8±19.4 nmol/l (p<0.01) in the vitamin D group, while remaining low in the placebo group (baseline and final levels at 35.1±13.6 nmol/l and 30.7 ±9.7 nmol/l respectively). Muscle strength (hip flexion, biceps flexion, pectorals and handgrip strength) did not change in any of the groups. The results were the same in analyses stratified on sex, 25(OH)D above/below 25 nmol/L (10 ng/ml); smoking status; and BMI above/below 27 kg/m 2 .    Conclusion  These data does not support vitamin D supplementation for improving muscle strength.
