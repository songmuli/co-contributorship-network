Patterns and determinants of modern contraceptive discontinuation among women of reproductive age: Analysis of Kenya Demographic Health Surveys, 2003–2014
  Objectives  This study aimed to examine patterns and determinants of modern contraceptive discontinuation among women in Kenya.    Methods  Secondary analysis was conducted using national representative Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys of 2003, 2008/9, and 2014. These household cross-sectional surveys targeted women of reproductive age from 15 to 49 years who had experienced an episode of modern contraceptive use within five years preceding the surveys from 2003 (n = 2686), 2008/9 (n = 2992), and 2014 (5919). The contraceptive discontinuation rate was defined as the number of episodes discontinued divided by the total number of episodes. Weighted descriptive statistics, multivariable logistic regression analysis, and Cox proportional hazards analysis were used to examine the determinants of contraceptive discontinuation.    Results  The 12-month contraceptive discontinuation rate for all methods declined from 37.5% in 2003 and 36.7% in 2008/9 to 30.5% in 2014. Consistently across the three surveys, intrauterine devices had the lowest 12-month discontinuation rate (6.4% in 2014) followed by implants (8.0%, in 2014). In 2014, higher rates were seen for pills (44.9%) and male condoms (42.9%). The determinants of contraceptive discontinuation among women of reproductive age in the 2003 survey included users of short-term contraception methods, specifically for those who used male condoms (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.13–5.11) and pills (HR = 2.68; 95CI = 1.79–4.00); and younger women aged 15–19 year (HR = 2.07; 95% CI = 1.49–2.87) and 20–24 years (HR = 1.94; 95% CI = 1.61–2.35). The trends in the most common reasons for discontinuation from 2003 to 2014 revealed an increase among those reporting side effects (p = 0.0002) and those wanting a more effective method (p<0.0001). A decrease was noted among those indicating method failure (p<0.0001) and husband disapproval (p<0.0001).    Conclusions  Family planning programs should focus on improving service quality to strengthen the continuation of contraceptive use among those in need. Women should be informed about potential side effects and reassured on health concerns, including being provided options for method switching. The health system should avail a wider range of contraceptive methods and ensure a constant supply of commodities for women to choose from. Short-term contraceptive method users and younger women may need greater support for continued use.
