A randomized pilot trial to evaluate the benefit of the concomitant use of atorvastatin and Raltegravir on immunological markers in protease-inhibitor-treated subjects living with HIV
  Objective  Optimization of antiretroviral therapy and anti-inflammatory treatments, such as statins, are among the strategies aimed at reducing metabolic disorders, inflammation and immune activation in people living with HIV (PLWH). We evaluated the potential benefit of combining both strategies.    Design  Forty-two PLWH aged â‰¥40 years receiving a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen were randomized (1:1) to switch from PI to Raltegravir (n = 20), or to remain on PI (n = 22). After 24 weeks, all patients received atorvastatin 20mg/day for 48 weeks.    Methods  We analyzed plasma inflammatory as well as T-cell maturation, activation, exhaustion and senescence markers at baseline, 24 and 72 weeks,    Results  Plasma inflammatory markers remained unchanged. Furthermore, no major changes on T-cell maturation subsets, immunoactivation, exhaustion or immunosenescence markers in both CD4 and CD8 T cell compartments were observed. Only a modest decrease in the frequency of CD38 + CD8 T cells and an increase in the frequency of CD28 - CD57 + in both CD4 and CD8 T-cell compartments were noticed in the Raltegravir-switched group.    Conclusions  The study combined antiretroviral switch to Raltegravir and Statin-based anti-inflammatory strategies to reduce inflammation and chronic immune activation in PLWH. Although this combination was safe and well tolerated, it had minimal impact on inflammatory and immunological markers.    Clinical Trials Registration  NCT02577042 .
