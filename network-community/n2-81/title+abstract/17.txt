Child development in the context of biological and psychosocial hazards among poor families in Bangladesh
 It is well established that low resource environments early in life can predispose children to adverse health and compromised developmental outcomes. We explore possible mechanistic pathways underlying poor developmental outcomes in children growing up in a low resource setting in urban Bangladesh. We tested associations between psychosocial risks, namely maternal distress and poor caregiving experiences, and biological risks, namely poor growth (HAZ) and inflammation (C-reactive protein: CRP), and children’s developmental outcomes. Child development was measured using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) at 6 and 27 months in one cohort, and using the MSEL and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) at 36 and 60 months respectively in another cohort. In the younger cohort, we found that more inflammation (estimated by the child’s CRP level at four months) predicted lower receptive language scores at 6 months, while more frequent caregiving interactions predicted higher receptive language scores at 6 months. In the older cohort, we found that at 27 months, a child’s growth measured by his or her current HAZ was positively associated with gross motor, visual reception, receptive language, and expressive language scores. In the oldest cohort, we found that higher HAZ and more frequent stimulating activities in the home predicted higher motor and language scores, whereas more inflammation (as estimated by CRP over the first two years of life) predicted lower motor scores at 36 months. At 60 months, we found that HAZ and caregiving experiences were positively associated with verbal IQ, whereas inflammation was negatively associated with verbal IQ. This work identifies malnutrition, inflammation, and caregiving as potential sites of intervention to improve neurodevelopment in children growing up in global poverty.
