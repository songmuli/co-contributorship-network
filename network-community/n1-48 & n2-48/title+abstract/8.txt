Periodontal disease influences osteoclastogenic bone markers in subjects with and without rheumatoid arthritis
  Background  Periodontal disease (PD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are bone pathologies mediated through immuno-inflammatory mechanisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the serum markers osteopontin (OPN), tumor necrosis factor receptors 1 (TNFR1) and 2 (TNFR2) receptor activator of nuclear factor‐kappa B ligand (RANKL) and RANKL/ osteoprotegerin (OPG) ratio and compare them in PD and RA groups.    Materials & methods  RA (with PD = 19 and without PD = 19), PD (n = 38) and 14 healthy subjects underwent bleeding on probing (BOP) and probing pocket depth (PPD) measurement. PD was defined as PPD measuring ≥5mm registered in ≥3 sites. Marginal bone loss (MBL) for premolars and molars was measured on digital panoramic radiographs. Serum samples were collected from all subjects. OPN, TNFR1, TNFR2 and RANKL were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). OPG was measured as part of a multiplex proximity extension assay (PEA).    Results  OPN, TNFR1, TNFR2 and RANKL serum levels were the highest in the RA group with PD, while the RA group without PD were comparable to PD subjects only. The RANKL/OPG ratios were comparable between PD group and both RA groups with (p = 0.051) and without PD (p = 0.37). Serum RANKL levels were associated with MBL (p = 0.008) and PPD ≥ 5mm (p = 0.01).    Conclusion  Peripheral osteoclastogenesis is a feature of periodontal disease with systemic levels of osteoclastogenic markers comparable to the effects observed in rheumatoid arthritis.
