18F-fluorocholine PET/CT in patients with occult biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: Detection rate, impact on management and adequacy of impact. A prospective multicentre study
  Aim  To prospectively evaluate the clinical impact and the diagnostic performance of FCH-PET/CT in patients with occult biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer (PCa).    Materials and methods  Results of 179 patients (mean PSA = 7.5ng/mL) with negative/inconclusive results of pelvic-MRI and of bone-scintigraphy were analysed. To determine the impact of FCH-PET/CT on diagnostic thinking and on patient management, the referring physicians prospectively filled-in a 1 st and 2 nd questionnaire related to patientâ€™s planned management before and after FCH-PET/CT. Based on data from a 6-month follow-up after FCH-PET/CT, an independent assessor blinded to results of FCH-PET/CT determined the adequacy of management changes motivated by FCH-PET/CT.    Results  FCH-PET/CT localised foci evocative of recurrent PCa in 59% (105/179) of patients. Results of FCH-PET/CT motivated a change in scheduled patient management in 56% (100/179) of patients; which was considered as adequate in 89% (89/100) of patients. FCH-PET/CT also led to the detection of lung cancer in two patients.    Conclusion  FCH PET/CT is a powerful tool to localise the sites of occult biochemical recurrence of PCa, leading to an adequate management change in half of patients.
