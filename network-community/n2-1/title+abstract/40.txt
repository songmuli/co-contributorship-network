Visceral leishmaniasis and HIV/AIDS in Brazil: Are we aware enough?
  Background  The urbanization of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and the concurrent movement of the HIV infection to rural areas in Brazil are possible mechanisms associated with an increased number of Leishmania /HIV coinfected people. This study aimed to describe the clinical and epidemiological profile of VL/HIV coinfected patients and compare this profile to non-coinfected VL patients.    Methods  Cases of VL/HIV coinfection were obtained through a probabilistic record linkage of databases of VL and AIDS cases from the Brazilian Ministry of Health.    Results  We retrieved 760 cases of VL/HIV coinfection, most prevalent in adult males, with incidence ranging from 0.01 to 0.07 cases, per 100.000 population, in 2001 and 2010, respectively. Case-fatality rates were 27.3% in 2001 and 23.2% in 2010. Weakness, weight loss, cough, other associated infections and haemorrhagic phenomena were more commonly found among coinfected patients, which had a fatality rate three times higher as compared to the non-coinfected group. The relapse proportion was two times greater among coinfected (6.3%) than non-coinfected (3.1%).    Conclusions  The results found herein contribute to the increase of knowledge of the epidemiological situation of VL/HIV coinfection in Brazil and reinforce the necessity of implementing specific strategies to improve early case detection and efficacious and less toxic treatment in order to achieve lower case-fatality rates.
